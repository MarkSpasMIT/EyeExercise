# EyeExercise

In this MIT Development course exercise, we display "eyes" that move on mouse direction. There are 3 files : a index.html file that contains "2 eyes" in div/class, a css file for the style and a eye.js file. In the eye.js file for the eye to move.   

## How to run

Just open the index.html file in your browser. Make sure the eye.js and styles.css are in the same directory as the index.html file. 
When the page is open, move your mouse and see how the eyes follow the mouse direction. 

## Roadmap of future improvements

Add button to change the color of the eye
Add functionality to recognize "smartphones" and move eyes on press+move of finger.
